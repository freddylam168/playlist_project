  A SOAP based Youtube video playlist exchange service. In this service, clients can upload playlists of Youtube videos and can access playlists from other clients. The service also ranks individual tracks based on the premise that a track listing gets one point for each playlist it appears in, and whole playlists based on the premise that clients can vote for other clientsâ€™ playlists (a range of 0 to 5 stars). Written in C#.
